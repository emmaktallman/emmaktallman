### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emma and I am in my last quarter of Drexel University's MS in Library and information sciences program.
I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology from George Washington University. 
I currently work as a nanny and as a library assistant at the Collingswood Public Library. 

I am interested in art, reading, and music. 

Here is a [link](https://github.com/MCLD/greatreadingadventure) to an interesting repository about public library services
